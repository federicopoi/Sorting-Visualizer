# Sorting Visualizer Project

Welcome to the Sorting Visualizer project! This project is designed to provide a visual representation of various sorting algorithms in action. This web-based application allows users to observe and understand how different sorting algorithms work by visually tracking the process of arranging a set of elements.

## Key Features

- **Interactive Visualization:** Watch as sorting algorithms rearrange elements in real-time, providing an engaging way to learn about their mechanics and efficiency.

- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms:** The project currently supports a range of sorting algorithms, including (mention the sorting algorithms you've implemented, such as Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.).

- **Customization:** Adjust the size of the array and observe how algorithms handle different data quantities.

- **Color Indications:** Observe changes in bar color to distinguish between the comparison and swapping of elements.

## Getting Started

To run the Sorting Visualizer project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/federicopoi/Sorting-Visualizer.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Sorting-Visualizer`
3. Install project dependencies: `yarn install`
4. Start the development server: `yarn start`
5. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000` to see the Sorting Visualizer in action.

## Available Scripts

- `yarn start`: Launches the development mode of the application, allowing you to view and interact with the sorting visualizer in your browser.

- `yarn test`: Initiates the test runner in interactive watch mode, enabling you to run tests for the project.

- `yarn build`: Builds the application for production, generating optimized and minified files in the `build` folder.

- `yarn eject`: Ejects from the Create React App setup, granting more control over configurations and dependencies. Note that this is irreversible.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome! If you'd like to add new sorting algorithms, enhance visualizations, or fix issues, feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests.

## Future Plans

- Expanding the collection of sorting algorithms.
- Real-time analysis of algorithm performance.
- User interface enhancements and customization options.

Thank you for checking out the Sorting Visualizer project. Dive into the world of sorting algorithms and enhance your understanding through interactive visualization!
